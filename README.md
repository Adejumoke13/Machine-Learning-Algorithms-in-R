PURPOSE OF STUDY 

For a long time, heart attacks have been known to mostly occur in people who are older but a recent study by the Cardio Metabolic Institute states that 1 in 5 heart attack patients are younger than 40 years of age. It is a serious condition that can lead to other ailments like stroke etc. regardless of a person’s age. Therefore, it has become important to track the known indicators of an impending heart attack early to ensure that people are provided with proper diagnosis and treatments. 

A hospital has gathered information on a few patients who had suffered from heart attacks and has documented a few factors that might influence heart attacks. The hospital would like to: 
•	 Rightly predict which patients are at risk of getting a heart attack 
•	Know if  the variables significant in predicting the patients that are at substantial risk of getting a heart attack? 
•	Know which gender is at the most risk of getting a heart attack?

Finally, the objective of the study is to create a model that can predict the patients that are at substantial risk of getting a heart attack from the available factors collected.
